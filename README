This s-learning is trying to setup a more collaborate learning environment to make self-learning more easy.                                                

For use case:

You can join or create a group for learning something, we provide wiki for knowledge collect/transfer, member's learning activity, ask and answer, many other SNS element.

Something you should know:

1: It is still under heavy development and UI re-design.              

2: I don't write test.

It is based on the community engine
